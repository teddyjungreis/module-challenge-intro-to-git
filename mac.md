## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? It's a version control system. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a software 
system, while GitHub is a cloud platform that utilizes git. 
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch to enable multiple people 
to experiment with new changes while not disrupting the main code foundation. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request lets people on a 
team know that a new branch in a repository has been pushed and they can 
examine it before merging it into the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working
 on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. The command to 
switch between branches is git checkout <existing_branch>.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does 
each command do? Git fetch allows you to download objects and refs from 
another repo, while git merge incorporates changes from the new commit into the 
current branch, and git pull updates the local version of a repo from a remote version. 
7. What is a merge conflict? It is an event when Git is unable to automatically 
resolve. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You can resolve it by opening the conflicted 
file, editing the code, staging the appropriate changes, committing the change,
 and then pushing it to remote.
